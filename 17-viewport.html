    * The HTML <meta> Element

    The <meta> element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

    The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but are used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.

    * Setting The Viewport

    The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

    The width=device-width part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device).

    The initial-scale=1.0 part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser.

    * base element
    The <base> element specifies the base URL and/or target for all relative URLs in a page.

    The <base> tag must have either an href or a target attribute present, or both.
